# Todo App

Personal project to learn React, Python, and full-stack development.

## What I'm Learning

- ### Backend (Python)

  - Object-Oriented Programming: Classes, inheritance, methods
  - Pydantic: Data validation and serialization
  - JSON handling: File I/O, data persistence
- ### Frontend (React + TypeScript)

  - React fundamentals: Components, JSX, props
  - TypeScript: Type safety, interfaces, generics
  - Modern tooling: Vite, hot reload, dev environment
  - CSS styling: Component styling, responsive design
- ### Full-Stack Integration

  - API design: How frontend talks to backend
  - Data flow: From UI actions to data persistence

## Why This Stack?

Honestly? I know it's not the "best" choice for Todo App (a simple HTML page is enough for that).
It's about learning new skills and improve them.
This is about the journey, not the destination.

## Current Progress

- âœ… Basic Task class in Python
- âœ… JSON data storage
- ðŸ”„ React frontend (next)

Just a learning project, nothing fancy! ðŸš€
